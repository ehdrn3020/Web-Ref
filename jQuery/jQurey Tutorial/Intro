#Downloading jQuery
There are two versions of jQuery available for downloading:

Production version - this is for your live website because it has been minified and compressed
Development version - this is for testing and development (uncompressed and readable code)

The jQuery library is a single JavaScript file, and you reference it with the HTML <script> tag 
(notice that the <script> tag should be inside the <head> section):

<head>
<script src="jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
</head>



#jQuery CDN
If you don't want to download and host jQuery yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

Google CDN:
<head>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
</head>

Microsoft CDN:
<head>
<script src="https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
</head>
