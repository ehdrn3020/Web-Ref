#Loop Through an Indexed Array
To loop through and print all the values of an indexed array, you could use a for loop, like this:
Example
<?php
$cars = array("Volvo", "BMW", "Toyota");
$arrlength = count($cars);

for($x = 0; $x < $arrlength; $x++) {
    echo $cars[$x];
    echo "<br>";
}
?>


#PHP Associative Arrays
Associative arrays are arrays that use named keys that you assign to them.
There are two ways to create an associative array: 
<?php
$age = array("Peter"=>"35", "Ben"=>"37", "Joe"=>"43");
echo "Peter is " . $age['Peter'] . " years old.";
?>
