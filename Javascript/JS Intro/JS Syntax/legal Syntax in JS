1]JavaScript Identifiers

Identifiers are names.
In JavaScript, identifiers are used to name variables (and keywords, and functions, and labels).
The rules for legal names are much the same in most programming languages.
In JavaScript, the first character must be a letter, or an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($).


2]Lower Camel Case:

JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter:
Ex: firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity.


3]JavaScript Character Set
JavaScript uses the Unicode character set.
