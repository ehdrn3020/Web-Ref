External scripts can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web page.
This example uses a full URL to link to a script:

Example
<script src="https://www.w3schools.com/js/myScript1.js"></script>

https://www.w3schools.com/js/myScript1.js
function myFunction() {
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML="Paragraph changed.";
}
